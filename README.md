# Capture the carbon!

Create a fun way to learn how CO2 emissions from industry is being captured and stored under the seabed. It should be an interactive illustration or a simple game.

Think minimum viable product! You only have 5 and half hour to create your solution.
Choose whatever platform and programming language you like. 

The winning team will be selected based on their score in 4 criterias:
- user interaction
- intuitive user experience
- illustration of how co2 is captured and stored
- fun

Submit your solution by creating a pull request to this GitHub repository or deliver a USB drive at the Capgemini stand by 15:00. Make a folder marked with your team name. It should contain your source files and a video showing gameplay/user interaction. Free screen recorder [here](https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder).
